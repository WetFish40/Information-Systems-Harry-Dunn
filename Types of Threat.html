			<h2>Forms of attack</h2>
				<p>New forms of attack appear increasingly these days, so it is crucial to familiarise yourself with some of the simpler forms of attack. Below is a list of the most common attacks you may encounter frequently.</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Malware</li>
				  <li>DoS and DDoS Attacks</li>
				  <li>Social Engineering</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Social engineering</h3>
				<p>Often the human behind the device is the path of least resistance to an attacker. They may use your device to access critical information if you forget to log out, or they may peer over your shoulder as you enter your password. Then they may later use that information to log into your account without authorization.</p>
				<h3>Phishing</h3>
				<p>Phishing is where cybercriminals trick users into doing something that could infect their device or pry information from a user, like login details or bank information. Phishing can come in many forms. Often phishing comes over e-mails from services the user uses, like bank firms or the NHS. The e-mail usually has tell-tale signs of being false; however, some are incredibly realistic [1]. Once a person clicks on an e-mail like this, they may be transported to a site where they can input information like login or bank details. After that, the attacker has full access to that information and can do with it as they please.</p>
				<h3>Password attacks</h3>
				<p>Cybercriminals prey on people with weak and easily guessable passwords. Sometimes they can even guess your password from social media pages, as people often use passwords that include their pets’ names, family members, or street addresses. They can often ‘brute-force’ your password. They guess a combination of characters and symbols to try and guess your password. It is most effective when the password only contains numbers.</p>
				<h3>Malware</h3>
				<p>Malware is a broad term for software designed to damage, disrupt, or help others gain unauthorized access to a user’s data. Malware comes in many forms, but the most common ones are:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Viruses</li>
				  <li>Spyware</li>
				  <li>Trojans</li>
				  <li>Ransomware</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Viruses: These are small pieces of software that execute unauthorized commands on a computer. The critical difference between viruses is that they are self-replicating, like viruses. They spread to many different programs making computers slow and often unresponsive. When active, they can modify data on your device without your permission.</p>
				<p>Spyware: Spyware is often unnoticeable to the person using the computer, and it aims to stay that way to avoid detection long enough to harvest critical data like banking information or passwords through keylogging. This takes note of every key you press on your keyboard, which could be sent to malicious parties.</p>
				<p>Trojans: Trojan viruses get their name from the Greek story involving the wooden horse with soldiers within, perfectly describing what type of malware trojans are. These pieces of software are used to disguise themselves as standard software when they are anything but. Users can be infected with malware when they click on a trojan piece of software. It is imperative to realize when a piece of software is not genuine.</p>
				<p>Ransomware: Ransomware commonly infects a device and then engages the user in a hostage situation. Promising to delete all their data and destroy their device unless they pay the person who infected the machine a commonly hefty fee to remove the ransomware. Typically, people pay the ransom only to find their data wiped anyway. Ransomware often uses encryption, making it especially hard to remove it from the system without the encryption codes.</p>
